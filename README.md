# Econometric Analysis of the Abalone Dataset

## Overview

This project presents an econometric analysis of the [Abalone dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/abalone), aiming to model and predict the age of abalone specimens based on various physical measurements. The analysis was initially conducted in Python and subsequently translated into R for academic purposes.

At this stage, the project is **not yet complete** — we have successfully **selected the appropriate features** for each considered model, but **the prediction phase is still a work in progress (TODO)**.

The dataset was **not standardized**, as we determined it was not strictly necessary for this stage of the analysis. Additionally, we retained interpretability of the original variable values throughout the process. A detailed report in Polish (`HollaStróżyk.pdf`), documenting the feature selection methodology and initial analysis, is included.

## Repository Structure

* **`projekt_python.ipynb`**: The original Jupyter Notebook containing the complete analysis in Python. It includes data loading, feature selection, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and partial modeling preparation.

* **`projekt_R.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook version of the analysis translated into R. It closely mirrors the Python notebook, allowing for a direct comparison between the two implementations.

* **`projekt_R.R`**: An R script version of the same analysis, structured similarly to the notebook but in a traditional script format.

* **`HollaStróżyk.pdf`**: A comprehensive report written in Polish, documenting the methodology and variable selection process in detail. It summarizes the reasoning behind choosing specific variables for further modeling.

* **`abalone_data_set.csv` / `abalone_data_set.xlsx`**: The dataset used for the analysis, provided in both CSV and Excel formats. It contains attributes such as:

  * Sex (categorical)
  * Length, Diameter, Height
  * Whole weight, Shucked weight, Viscera weight, Shell weight
  * Number of Rings (used to estimate age)

* **`Korelacja_podstawowe_zmienne_Płeć_F.png`**, **`Korelacja_podstawowe_zmienne_Płeć_I.png`**, **`Korelacja_podstawowe_zmienne_Płeć_M.png`**: Correlation heatmaps for each sex category — female (F), infant (I), and male (M) — visualizing relationships between numerical features.

## Methodology

The workflow adopted in this project includes:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing data (if any), encoding categorical features (sex), and deciding whether or not to normalize variables (not done here for interpretability).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Summary statistics and graphical analyses (including correlation matrices by sex) to understand variable distributions and relationships.

3. **Feature Selection**: Identifying which variables are most informative for predicting the age of abalone. This phase is documented in detail in both code and the report.

4. **Modeling (Upcoming)**: The next planned step involves building and comparing econometric regression models based on the selected features.

5. **Model Evaluation (Upcoming)**: The final step will involve evaluating predictive accuracy using appropriate statistical metrics.

## Notes

* The **Python version** of the analysis was fully written manually by the author.
* The **R version** (both `.ipynb` and `.R`) was generated by translating the Python code, with the assistance of ChatGPT to ensure language consistency.
* The dataset used is from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/abalone) and has been bundled for convenience.
* Prediction is **not yet implemented** — feature selection is finalized and modeling is the next step.
* No standardization was applied, as it was not required for the initial phase, and original scales aid in result interpretation.
