# Econometric Analysis of the Abalone Dataset

## Overview

This project presents an econometric analysis of the [Abalone dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/abalone), aiming to model and predict the age of abalone specimens based on various physical measurements. The analysis was initially conducted in Python and subsequently translated into R for academic purposes.

The dataset was **not standardized**, as we determined it was not strictly necessary for this stage of the analysis. Additionally, we retained interpretability of the original variable values throughout the process. A detailed report in Polish (`HollaStróżyk.pdf`), documenting the feature selection methodology and initial analysis, is included.

## Repository Structure

* **`projekt_python.ipynb`**: The original Jupyter Notebook containing the complete analysis in Python. It includes data loading, feature selection, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and partial modeling preparation.

* **`projekt_R.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook version of the analysis translated into R. It closely mirrors the Python notebook, allowing for a direct comparison between the two implementations.

* **`projekt_R.R`**: An R script version of the same analysis, structured similarly to the notebook but in a traditional script format.

* **`HollaStróżyk.pdf`**: A comprehensive report written in Polish, documenting the methodology and variable selection process in detail. It summarizes the reasoning behind choosing specific variables for further modeling.

* **`abalone_data_set.csv` / `abalone_data_set.xlsx`**: The dataset used for the analysis, provided in both CSV and Excel formats. It contains attributes such as:

  * Sex (categorical)
  * Length, Diameter, Height
  * Whole weight, Shucked weight, Viscera weight, Shell weight
  * Number of Rings (used to estimate age)

* **`Korelacja_podstawowe_zmienne_Płeć_F.png`**, **`Korelacja_podstawowe_zmienne_Płeć_I.png`**, **`Korelacja_podstawowe_zmienne_Płeć_M.png`**: Correlation heatmaps for each sex category — female (F), infant (I), and male (M) — visualizing relationships between numerical features.

## Methodology

The workflow adopted in this project includes:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing data (if any), encoding categorical features (sex), and deciding whether or not to normalize variables (not done here for interpretability).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Summary statistics and graphical analyses (including correlation matrices by sex) to understand variable distributions and relationships.

3. **Feature Selection**: Identifying which variables are most informative for predicting the age of abalone. We doing this by using permutation tests/

4. **Adjusting scale**: We drop observations which are not in range of (0, 0.95) quantile. The reason behind this is that we have very wide range of ages and margin values make model less accurate with most common data. 

5. **Box–Cox transformation**: At the end we use box-cox transformation with optimized value. 

## Notes

* The **Python version** of the analysis was fully written manually by the author.
* The **R version** (both `.ipynb` and `.R`) was generated by translating the Python code, with the assistance of ChatGPT to ensure language consistency.
* The dataset used is from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/abalone) and has been bundled for convenience.
* No standardization was applied, as it was not required for the initial phase, and original scales aid in result interpretation.
* In normal case scenario, we would need to change our procedure. That is because in course we were given instructions to proceed in certain way. I would firstly decide about on which interval we want to do our prediction, than use transformation, (we would have normality assumptions much faster, we could use F test because of assumption of normality distributions of error). After transformations we check if leverage values, interact with R score on test set.
* We could also approach problem with classification methods. Problem was that we were limited to linear model and logistic regression were not behaving well.
